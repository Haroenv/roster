# Roster.js

A simple node stript (trying out how it works) that will read a lesson roster in json format, and then pretty print it or of a certain day (command line argument either `zo,ma,di,wo,do,vr,za` or a number from `0` to `6`).

Plans to make it do more than a commandline output are made but not seen as very necessary.
