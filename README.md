# Roster.js

A simple node stript (trying out how it works) that will read a lesson roster in json format, and then pretty print it or of a certain day (command line argument either `zo,ma,di,wo,do,vr,za` or a number from `0` to `6`).

Plans to make it do more than a commandline output are made but not seen as very necessary.


# Usage

`node roster.js` or `node roster.js all` for everything
`node roster.js 1` or `node roster.js ma` for monday.

# Example

The roster of 2ICT3 of 2015-2016 at Odisee is included as an example (and because it's mine).
